Each line contains a pair of section ID ranges.
Some pairs have overlapping values ( eg. 1-3, 2-4 - 2 and 3 are shared)
Some pairs have a range which is fully contained within the other (eg. 1-5, 2-4)

Part 1:
Find the number of pairs where one fully contains the other

Algo:
Parse pairs into ranges
For each pair, determine if one range is fully contained within the other.
