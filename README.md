This is a repository containing all of my solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code problems, solved in NodeJS

# Running
To run, just check out the package and run the following:

Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

Run the challenge picker
```sh
npm run aoc
```

The challenge picker allows you to choose a challenge day to run from the command line. To get full context however, you will need to access the original question on adventofcode.com, as most scripts simply output the answers without any context of the question.
